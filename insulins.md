## Long and short acting insulins in Critical Care
There are now so many different types of insulin available on the market that keeping up to speed with the names and actions of these drugs is at best hard work and for most of us not working directly in Diabetes medicine, a waste of our attention. Whilst there are many resources out there to educate on the specifics of when and how to give these drugs, in this section I just want to cover some of the pharmacology of these desginer insulins and why it matters to us in Critical Care.  
So take a moment to do some non-mandatory learning...

### Human insulin
For many decades after the discovery in dogs, the mainstay of treatment for those with type 1 insulin was insulin isolated from the pancreases of cows (bovine) and pigs (porcine). It wasn't until the discovery of recombinent DNA technology that human insulin could be produced by inseting human DNA into bacteria and mass producing insulin that has the same molecular structure to insulin that humans make in their own pancreas.

This insulin is what we commonly called "Human Insulin" and you'll know it as soluble insulin **Humilin S** or **Actrapid**
