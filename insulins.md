# Understanding Insulin in Critical Care


## Introduction


There are now so many different insulins out there that it's no wonder that for most of us not working in diabetes medicine, trying to remember what the difference between Toujeo and Levemir is beyond most peoples attention span when we have so many other important things to remember. There are many resources out there with cheatsheets to look up the duration of action of each of these insulins.

Rather than repeat that here, this will be an overview of what makes designer insulins different to insulin made in the pancreas and why it matters to our patients in ICU. 

## Human insulin


For many decades after the isolation of insulin in dogs by Banting and Best, the mainstay of treatment for those with type 1 insulin was insulin isolated from the pancreases of cows (bovine) and pigs (porcine). This animal insulin caused loads of problems at the site of injection with skin reactions and immune reactions to the insulin itself. It wasn't until the discovery of recombinent DNA technology that human insulin could be produced by inserting human DNA into bacteria and mass producing insulin that has the same molecular structure to insulin that humans make in their own pancreas.


This insulin is what we commonly called "Human Insulin" and you'll know it as soluble insulin **Humilin S** or **Actrapid**.

So Actrapid and Humilin S are exactly the same molecule as the insulin made in a healthy human pancreas. They act in the same way on cells in the body, increasing the uptake of glucose into muscle (and liver) and stopping the production of glucose by the liver. 

So if it's the same molecule and it acts in the same way why do we need to change it? Surely it'll work just the same when we inject it?


Unfortunately not...


## It's how we give it that matters


#### From the Pancreas

Insulin released from the beta cells in the tail of the pancreas enters the portal vein where it acts immediately on the liver to

* switch off glucose production (gluconeogenesis)
* move glucose transporters into the cell wall
* convert this glucose into glycogen (glycogenolyis)
* switches off the production of glucagon by the alpha cells of the pancreas (they lie right next to the alpha cells)

This means that the onset of action is almost immediate. 

Importantly though the same is true of it's offset when blood glucose falls. The beta cells are very sensitive as glucose drops and stop insulin production. This results in glucagon production and a reversal of the above process, glygogen is turned into glucose and glucose pumped out the cells of the liver into the blood.

#### Into a Vein

When we administer insulin intravenously it still works quickly and has a powerful action but as it takes time and is diluted on the way round to the liver, the effects will never be as quick or potent for the same amount of insulin released in the pancreas. We therefore need to give more to have the same effect and the more we give, the more hangs around after we stop.

If blood glucose levels fall and we are fortunate to catch it with our monitoring,even after switching off the infusion there will be a significant amount of insulin circulating for a good while after. This means glucagon release is suppressed despite a falling blood glucose and the liver will continue to remove glucose from the blood.
