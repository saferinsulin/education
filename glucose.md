# What is the target range gor glucose in critical care?


The has been a lot of interest in controlling glucose in ICU over the years and there remains debate as to the ideal target glucose in critically ill patients. To try to cover this in depth and provide detailed analysis of all the contributing studies would be lengthy and for most reading these pages boring. For an up to date review check out this article by xxxx. The following is therefore a brief summary of the major trials published in the last 25 years, the most recnet guidelines and what we actually do on our unit based on all of this. 


## The research so far (as of 2025!)


## What do the guidelines say?


## What do we do?

Our unit practice is to aim for 6-10mmol/l for all patients who are in the acute stages of critical illness. This is most safely achieved by using a VRII in our ICU provided we monitor blood glucose frequently. If a patient's blood glucose is above 10mmol/l we ask for it be repeated within 2 hours and insulin should be started if persistently above 10mmol/l.


As a patient's critical illness recovers and they are moving towards discharge from critical care, the benefit of controlling glucose is likely to get less and the burden of treatment becomes less acceptable. It is reasonable to redefine glucose targets to ward level care (6-12mmol/l) once a patient is eating and drinking or established on enteral feed, no longer requiring multiorgan support and is in a period of weaning. Whilst a VRII remains an option for short term use, restarting usual diabetes medications, using long acting insulin and correction of hyperglycaemia with short acting subcutaneous insulin (actrapid) makes more sense and becomes less risky.
