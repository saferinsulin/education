Monitoring of blood glucose levels

- All patients will have an admission blood glucose checked either via an ABG / VBG sample or a laboratory glucose (yellow top tube)

- A raised blood glucose > 10 mmol/L should be repeated within 2 hours and if persistently elevated the doctor / ACCP covering the unit should be informed.

- An unexpectedly high or low sample taken from an arterial line or central line port may represent dilution from the flush line or contamination with glucose and should be checked with capillary point-of-care (POC) sample. The contents of the flush solution must be checked to confirm that it contains no glucose.  Similarly, POC capillary glucose is the least accurate method and an unexpectedly abnormal sample should be check against an arterial or venous blood gas analysis.

- If Variable Rate Insulin Infusion is commenced, then blood glucose should be checked 1 hourly, ideally via ABG / VBG.  POC Capillary Sampling is acceptable if patientâ€™s glucose control has been stable to over the preceding 24 hours and no arterial or central line access is available for monitoring. There may be considerable difference between POC analysis and gas analyser results (up to 2mmol/L) so once one method is used it is preferable to continue with this. Unexpected or grossly abnormal results must be checked with another device.

- If a Variable Rate Insulin Infusion is being stopped and is no longer required, blood glucose should be monitored hourly for **at least 4 hours after stopping**: this is particularly relevant when suspending for procedures or scans.
