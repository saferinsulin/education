# Hyperglycaemia

Monitoring of blood glucose levels

- All patients will have an admission blood glucose checked either via an ABG / VBG sample or a laboratory glucose (yellow top tube)

- Patients commencing enteral or parenteral feed need their BG monitoring every 4-6 hours.

- A raised blood glucose > 10 mmol/l should be repeated within 2 hours and if persistently elevated the doctor / ACCP covering the unit should be informed.

- An unexpectedly high or low sample taken from an arterial line or central line port may represent dilution from the flush line or contamination with glucose and should be checked with capillary POC sample. The contents of the flush solution must be checked to confirm that it contains no glucose.  Similarly, POC capillary glucose is the least accurate method and an unexpectedly abnormal sample should be check against an arterial or venous blood gas analysis.

- If Variable Rate Insulin Infusion is commenced, then blood glucose should be checked 1 hourly ideally via ABG / VBG or POC Capillary Sampling is acceptable if patient’s glucose control has been stable to over the preceding 24 hours and no arterial or central line access is available for monitoring. There may be considerable difference between POC analysis and gas analyser results (up to 2mmol/l) so once one method is used it is preferable to continue with this. Unexpected or grossly abnormal results must be checked with another device.

- If a Variable Vate Insulin Infusion is being stopped and is no longer required blood glucose should be monitored hourly for at least 2 hours post stopping, this is particularly relevant when stopping for procedures or scan.

- Patients admitted with Covid - 19

- People with COVID-19 infection appear to have a greater risk of hyperglycaemia with ketones including:
- People with type 2 diabetes (risk even greater if on a SGLT-2 inhibitor)
- People with newly diagnosed diabetes COVID-19 disease precipitates atypical presentations of diabetes emergencies (eg, mixed DKA and hyperosmolar states).

- Fluid requirements may differ in those with DKA/HHS and evidence of “lung leak” or myocarditis

- Significant insulin resistance seen in people with type 2 diabetes in critical care  settings requiring modification of conventional VRII regimens or the addition of basal insulin.
