# Glycaemic control in patients admitted with COVID-19

- People with COVID-19 infection appear to have a greater risk of hyperglycaemia with ketones including:
- People with type 2 diabetes (risk even greater if on a SGLT-2 inhibitor)
- People with newly diagnosed diabetes COVID-19 disease precipitates atypical presentations of diabetes emergencies (eg, mixed DKA and hyperosmolar states).

- Fluid requirements may differ in those with DKA/HHS and evidence of “lung leak” or myocarditis

- Significant insulin resistance seen in people with type 2 diabetes in critical care  settings requiring modification of conventional VRII regimens or the addition of basal insulin.
