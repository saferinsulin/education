# Metformin

## What is it and how does it work?

#### **Metformin is the first line treatment for type 2 diabetes in most countries. It is cheap, effective at lowering blood glucose and has been shown to reduce the risk of death in people with type 2 diabetes**

### How does it work?
We know quite a lot about how metformin works but there's still a lot that we don't know. For an excellent overview of it's many suspected mechanisms of action see these two articles by xxxet al and xxx et al. I've done my best to summarise them here for those short on time but you'll see how it's not that simple!
#### Glucose lowering effects
Metformin seems to work through multiple pathways
1. Reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis - the liver pumps out about 200g of glucose a day in normal health. Metformin acts to block the function of the mitocondria within the hepatocyte which reduces the amount of glucose being released into the blood. This is thought to happen through a few different routes including blocking the production of ATP and enzymes that induce glconeogensis
2. In the intestine - metformin has been shown to increase glucose use by enterocytes on the intestinal wall which may reduce the amount of glucose entering the circulation
3. The Microbiome - interstingly, one study showed that metformin that is given in a delayed release tablet and that remained in the gut without being absorbed, showed powerful glucose reducing effects suggesting an interaction with the microbiome.


#### Non-glucose effects
1. As metformin acts on intracellular pathways in many different cell types, it is thought to have effects on immune function, cellular growth and inflammation. This may be important in that there is the suggestion that it may be protective in patients who present with critical illness (see below).
2. Metformin has been shown to reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer and stroke and it is thought that this may be separate to just it's glucose lowering effect in diabetes. It's effect on the enzymes involved in cellular proliferation make it an interesting drug for reducing the risk of these diseases in people who don't have diabetes and it is being trialled as a drug for longevity.

## Safety in Critical Care
Most of the concerns about safety for metformin are related to the risk of lactic acidosis. Before reviewing this it's important to state that **metformin does not cause hypoglycaemia in normal use** and this should not be a consideration when deciding to prescribe. It does cause gastrointestinal side effects in normal use such as diarrhoea and bloating which is a common reason for it to be stopped in the community. This is rarely a contraindication in critical care


Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis is a serious and not entirely rare complication of metformin use. Metformin is not metabolised by the liver and is excreted unchanged in the urine. It is a small molecule so filtered easily and renal function needs to decline significantly before toxic effects are apparent. Most cases of MALA are in patients who continue to take metformin and experience an acute illness that causes AKI. The presentation is dramatic with severe lactic acidosis and whilst it is quickly reversible with resuscitation and renal replacement, mortality remains high.

Traditionally metformin has been held in patinets admitted to intensive care either (rightly) because of the concern about lactic acidosis or (in my opinion wrongly) because of concerns about hypoglycaemia. 

A study from xxx demonstrated that
