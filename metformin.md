# Metformin

## What is it and how does it work?

#### **Metformin is the first line treatment for type 2 diabetes in most countries. It is cheap, effective at lowering blood glucose and has been shown to reduce the risk of death in people with type 2 diabetes**

### How does it work?
We know quite a lot about how metformin works but there's still a lot that we don't know. For an excellent overview of it's many suspected mechanisms of action see these two articles by xxxet al and xxx et al. I've done my best to summarise them here for those short on time but you'll see how it's not that simple!
#### Glucose lowering effects
Metformin seems to work through multiple pathways
1. Reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis - the liver pumps out about 200g of glucose a day in normal health. Metformin acts to block the function of the mitocondria within the hepatocyte which reduces the amount of glucose being released into the blood. This is thought to happen through a few different routes including blocking the production of ATP and enzymes that induce glconeogensis
2. In the intestine - metformin has been shown to increase glucose use by enterocytes on the intestinal wall which may reduce the amount of glucose entering the circulation
3. The Microbiome - fascinatingly, one study showed that metformin that is given in a delayed release tablet and that remained in the gut without being absorbed, showed powerful glucose reducing effects suggesting an interaction with the microbiome.
