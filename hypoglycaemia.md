# Hypoglycaemia

## Introduction

- Avoidance of hypoglycaemia is a key priority in patients being treated for hyperglycaemia on critical care. Hypoglycaemia is associated with a significantly elevated risk of mortality in critically ill patients and the effect may be related to the severity of the hypoglycaemia.

- Hypoglycaemia may be absolute or relative. Patients with pre-existing diabetes with poor control may exhibit cardiovascular, hormonal and neurological changes at low-normal levels. Aggressively targeting a blood glucose in the “normal” range may be harmful in these patients.

- Minimising hypoglycaemia in critical care will consist of three aims: Avoidance, Treatment & Learning from Hypoglycaemia.

## Avoidance of Hypoglycaemia

- Monitoring of blood glucose should be 1 hourly when on an insulin infusion. If blood glucose has been stable and between 6 – 10 mmol/l for the last 4 hours, then extend to 2 hourly intervals.

- Monitoring frequency should increase to every 30 minutes if blood glucose has dropped below 6.0mmol/l and on an insulin infusion until glucose has been demonstrably stable above 6.0 mmol/l for 2 hours (insulin infusion will have been stopped and discussed with the medical team).

- Any period of instability in either the patients’ glucose control or in their general condition should prompt return to one hourly monitoring until stability is reached.
- Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 hours when on a long acting subcutaneous insulin regardless of mode of nutrition

- Minimising interruptions to glucose supply. Any patient receiving enteral feed which is interrupted either deliberately (e.g. for procedures) or unintentionally due to tube displacement should be managed according to the following protocol:

  - Anticipated stop for transfer or procedure: stop insulin 1 hour before and monitor blood glucose every hour as per protocol

  - Unanticipated stop (e.g. NG tube displacement or urgent scan): stop Variable Rate Insulin Infusion immediately, increase frequency of monitoring to every 30 minutes for 2 hours.

  - Feed stopped for > 2hours: stop Variable Rate Insulin Infusion and consider prescription of 10% glucose infusion at 50 mls/hr

## Treatment of Hypoglycaemia

- Management of an episode of hypoglycaemia in the critical care should be according to a treatment protocol that is weighted differently to ward areas. This reflects the patient population being less likely to be conscious and able to report hypoglycaemia symptoms and the likelihood of central venous access making the use of 50% glucose safe and more practical. Management should consist of a step wise protocol (see algorithm).

> **Treatment should be initiated if blood glucose < 4.0mmol/l – Four is the Floor**

## Learning from Hypoglycaemia

- It should be recognised that hypoglycaemia is a common and sometimes unavoidable side effect of glucose management in the Critical Care Unit. The causes of hypoglycaemia are multifactorial. Steps should be taken to minimise further episodes where possible.

Patients at High Risk of Hypoglycaemia

1. Interruptions in glucose supply – such as NG feeding / tube displacement.
2. Type 1 diabetes or those deemed insulin sensitive.
3. Use of basal insulins especially in those with hepatic or renal impairment
4. Injecting insulin into the arm
5. Mis match of meal time insulin to meals
6. Long acting sulphonylurea agents
7. History of hypoglycaemia unawareness

- Patients suitable for stepdown to a general ward or with a normally functioning enteral route - refer to the trust algorithm
