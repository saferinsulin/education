# Hypoglycaemia

In this article i'm going to cover:
* why hypo's in ICU are so dangerous
* what we can do to avoid them
* how to treat them and why we should do it differently in critical care
* why glucagon is the wrong drug in most cases in ICU

## Hypo's in Critical Care Are Very Dangerous

I will start by stating what must of us know to be true: **Hypoglycaemia is associated with a significantly elevated risk of mortality in critically ill patients**.
In the worst case scenario a patient having a severe hypo that isn't treated quickly can rapidly develop irreversible brain damage and there are many awful case reports of catastrophic brain injury resulting in patients dying or ending up in a persistent vegetative state, all as a result of insulin therapy given to try to make the glucose "normal". Seems a pretty awful consequence to a treatment that has only limtied benefits...

Even those hypo's that don't result in an obvious neurological injury may have serious consequences, with measurable effects on hormones like cortisol, growth hormone and adrenaline. 

If you've ever looked after or know a person with type 1 diabetes where hypo's are a fact of life, they'll tell you how awful they feel for many hours after a severe hypo. Now imagine that person mounting a response to sepsis, major trauma or surgery, it's not surpising theres a link. 

#### How do we reduce this harm?

1. **Avoidance**
2. **Treatment**
3. **Learning** from Hypoglycaemia.

## Avoidance of Hypoglycaemia

Low blood sugar occurs for many reasons on ICU. Many hypo's in our audits are due to fasting due to illness or being nil by mouth. The easiest way to avoid these is to ensure patients have some glucose in their IV fluids until their nutrition has been established.

We are most concerned though with hypoglycaemia caused by insulin. 

The main way to avoid this is follow the guidelines on monitoring:

> On IV insulin blood glucose must be checked every 1 hour (2 hourly only when stable)
>
> On subcutaneous insulin blood glucose must be checked every 3-4 hours

#### Looming Hypoglycaemia

This is where the blood glucose is still in the normal range but is falling and a hypo is very likely. For this reason we should stop all IV insulin when blood glucose is below 6mmol/l and check again in the next 30 minutes. It would be entirely reasonable to treat with glucose to avoid it falling further. Recoginising it is key.



### No Feed No Need!

- Most of our patients on IV insulin will be on enteral feed or TPN. If this is stopped, for example when nil by mouth for surgery or unexpectedly because the tube is displaced or a check XR requested, the safest thing to do is to stop the insulin and keep checking blood glucose frequently. The risk of a hypo continues for many hours after the infusion is stopped. It is reasonable to

## Treatment of Hypoglycaemia

Follow the algorithm for to treat hypoglycaemia. You may notice that the emphaiss in our protocol is on using 50% glucose as first line rather than oral glucose tablets or glucagon. This is because our patients are much more likely to to have central or peripheral venous access and this is the quickest way to treat the hypo. All our hypo treatments are in the hypo boxes on the unit to speed up treatment. 

A patient on a medical ward on long-acting insulin who becomes hypoglycaemic will often develop symptoms that will alert us to a hypo. If they're able to take glucose tablets and don't have IV access, the quickest and safest way to treat the hypo may be orange juice, glucose tablets or glucogel.

A patient on ICU who is sedated on a ventilator will show no signs of hypoglycaemia and if on IV insulin will require rapid treatment. They will almost certainly have a central or peripheral line and therefore the quickest and safest way to treat them will be with IV glucose.

##### How much glucose?

* 50ml of 50% glucose 
* 250ml of 10% glucose

Both of these doses contain 25g of glucose which is equal 5 teaspoons. 

An _average adult only has about 50g of glucose dissolved in their entire blood volume***_ so this may well result in rebound hyperglycaemia. This will almost certainly by transient but will at least reduce the risk of a further hypo from the ongoing effects of circulating insulin. 

***this is pretty incredible, the human body is able to tightly regulate the amount of glucose in the blood to within 1/2 and 1 teaspoon, even after a massive meal!
