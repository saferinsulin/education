# The Goldilocks Range for Glucose in ICU


This is a topic that has been extensively debated in the literature over the years and this whilst i've aimed to summarise some of the key points, trials and artices here, I would urge the reader interested in the detail to read published literature reviews such as [this one in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocringology from 2024](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00058-5/fulltext). For a non peer reviewed summary of where i believe we are at please continue...

My conclusion from the last 30 years of major studies of glucose in critical care can be crystalised into the following 4 axioms:

:::
- **Avoidance of hypoglycaemia is of paramount importance** as this has been associated with worse outcomes in critically ill patients.

- **Hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients is very common** and may be associated with a pre-existing diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus or may represent a stress response to critical illness.

- **Avoidance of hyperglycaemia is desirable** and the treatment of blood glucose above which insulin should commence is 10 mmol/L with a target range of 6.0-10 mmol/L.

- **Minimising glucose variability** and **increasing time in target range** are important secondary targets.

## Why do we start treatment above 10mmol/l?

> "Clinicians should initiate glycemic management protocols and procedures to treat persistent hyperglycemia, ≥ 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) in critically ill adults"
[*Society of Critical Care Medicine Guidelines on Glycemic Control for Critically Ill Children and Adults 2024*](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/fulltext/2024/04000/society_of_critical_care_medicine_guidelines_on.22.aspx)

Most intensive care nurses and doctors understand that we should start treatment with insulin when a patient's blood glucose gets high enough but in my experience there's a lot of variation in when we actually start treating. Many adopt a "watch and wait" strategy when presented with a new admission with a blood glucose of eg 11.4mmol/l. 


We know from many large cohort studies that uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is associated with harm. This mostly comes from increased risk of infections (particularly surgical site and pneumonia) as well as acute kidney injury, increased length of stay and mortality.


Early studies such as the often cited Leuwen trial showed that it's possible to reduce these risks by adopting strict control of blood glucose using IV insulin and whist concerns were raised about the risks of using very intensive strategies, it's accepted that avoiding hyperglycaemia is desirable. 


When to pull the trigger and start treatment for each individual patient is a very complicated balance of risks and benefits. International consensus guidelines for critically ill adults recommend starting at 10mmol/l. The [Centre for Perioperative Care Guidelines](https://abcd.care/sites/default/files/site_uploads/JBDS_Guidelines_Current/JBDS_03_CPOC_Diabetes_Surgery_Guideline_Updated_2022.pdf) for patients undergoing surgery in the UK quote a target range of 6-12mmol/l for patients on insulin whilst the (now quite old) medical inpatient guidelines from JBDS recommend 6-10mmol/l for medical inpatients and advise treatment above 10mmol/l.

The more recent surgical guidelines may reflect the tendency for us to be more wary of over treating hyperglycaemia and causing hypoglycaemia for inpatients on general wards. In ICU we have better resources to provide frequent monitoring so it is considered safe to start treatment at 10mmol/l.


In conclusion, for patients who are critically ill and have a blood glucose above 10mmol/l, starting IV insulin is evidence-based and may reduce complications such as infection and kidney injury. Delaying for many hours to "see if it settles by itself" can often result in requiring more insulin to acheive the target range, particularly if glucose has continued to climb and this is why our guideliens advise starting IV insulin after 2 readings within 2 hours.
